# OlympusMLS203-2Adapter
Adapter for Thorlabs MLS203-2 (Zeiss) xy stage on Olympus microscope

This is a simple adapter for mounting a ThorLabs MLS203-2 XY stage (with hole patterns designed for a Zeiss microscope) onto an Olympus inverted scope. Tested in ABS on an Olympus IX83.

3.3 mm diameter holes at the outer edge of the part are meant to be M4x0.7 tapped. 10mm long M4 screws work well for affixing the MLS203 to the bracket. Holes towards the center are for M5 cap screws for affixing to the microscope itself. Build 2x and mount with M4 threaded hole sides oriented towards the center of the microscope.
